# Digit recongnition using Neural Network in RStudio, Python & SAS

## Database
The database used in all three examples is the MNIST database of handwritten digits. The database is created by: Yann LeCun, Courant Institute, NYU, Corinna Cortes, Google Labs, New York, and Christopher J.C. Burges, Microsoft Research, Redmond. The database is found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

#### CSV version
In these examples the more conviniet .CSV file created by Joseph Redmon is used. It can be downloadet from: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv.

## Experiment setup
The goal is to use the NN algorithm to classify the digits in the 10 different classes ranging from 0 to 9. The split between training and test is 50/50. Amount of observations included is 1000 training and 1000 test, with the K-value of 1.
